# Question: Develop a Python program to read the data from the CSV file into a pandas data frame,
# to find the top 5 players with the highest number of goals scored and the top 5 players with the
# highest salaries. Also calculate the average age of players and display the names of players who are
# above the average age and visualize the distribution of players based on their positions using a bar
# chart.
