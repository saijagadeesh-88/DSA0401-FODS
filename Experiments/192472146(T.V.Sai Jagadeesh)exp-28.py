# Write a Python program that loads the car dataset and allows the user to input the features of a new car
# they want to sell. The program should use the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm
# from scikit-learn to predict the price of the new car based on the input features. The CART algorithm
# will create a tree-based model that will split the data into subsets based on the chosen features and their
# values, leading to a decision path that eventually predicts the price of the car. The program should
# output the predicted price and display the decision path (the sequence of conditions leading to the
# prediction) for the new car.
